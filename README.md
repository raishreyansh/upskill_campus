## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Java-based Music Player App with music playback and playlist management features. The application allows users to manage their music collection, create custom playlists, and store playlist data in a MySQL database for easy retrieval and organization of audio titles and user playlists.

## Requirements
To run the Music Player App, ensure you have the following requirements installed on your system:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

The Music Player App's graphical user interface (GUI) will appear, allowing you to interact with the application and enjoy music playback and playlist management.

## Usage
- **Main Menu:** The main menu displays options to view existing playlists, create a new playlist, or exit the application.
- **Playlist Management:** When creating a new playlist, you can name it and add songs from your music collection. Existing playlists can be selected to view and manage the songs they contain.
- **Music Playback:** Upon selecting a playlist or song, the app will start playing the music. You can control playback using the provided buttons (play, pause, stop, skip).
